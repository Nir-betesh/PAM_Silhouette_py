# PAM & Silhouette Algorithm Implementation (Python)
This project implements the PAM (Partitioning Around Medoids) and Silhouette algorithms efficiently using Python. These algorithms are widely used in cluster analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters in a dataset.

# Features
* Efficient Implementation: The algorithms are implemented in Python to ensure ease of use and readability.
* Utilization of Special Features of Registers: Special features of registers are not applicable in Python, but the implementation focuses on optimizing algorithmic efficiency.
* Input: The code takes a distance matrix of size N x N as input.
* Output: The output of the code is the optimal number of clusters determined by the algorithms.
Usage
To run the code, follow these steps:

Clone Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Replace <repository_url> with the URL of this repository.
Navigate to Project Folder: Navigate to the project folder using the command line or terminal.
Run Python Script: Run the Python script pam_silhouette.py using Python:
Copy code
python pam_silhouette.py
Results
The implementation has been tested with various input sizes, including a distance matrix of size 10,000 x 10,000. The results demonstrate successful and efficient clustering with this large input size.

Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
